I grew up in Wisconsin and spent my high school years in Seattle, where my passion for chemistry first sparked. During my first year at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, I discovered a love for data science (via Python!), which complemented my scientific interests. I pursued these passions through research in the departments of Chemical Engineering and Biochemistry, which you can explore further in my projects section.

Beyond my core research, I took a range of courses that caught my interest. My favorite data science-related courses delved into geocomputing and artificial intelligence, providing me with a broad foundational understanding across many topics.

This website serves to document my ongoing learning and project work, helping me to further pinpoint my interests and eventually specialize. Currently, I'm particularly drawn to geocomputing applications and building predictive models, often just for my own amusement and to explore questions I have about the world.

While I enjoy coding and problem-solving, it's only one facet of my life. I love spending time outdoors â€“ hiking, surfing, and swimming are some of my favorite activities. I also enjoy weightlifting, hanging out with friends, going to concerts, making music, and studying languages.
