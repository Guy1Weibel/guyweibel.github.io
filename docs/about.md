I have a B.S. in Chemistry, and Data Science.
During university, I spent three years researching in the Chemical Engineering and Biochemistry departments. My experiences taught me how to work backward from a question, design experiments to test my ideas, and draw conclusiong with effective visualization and communication. I plan to use these skills to learn more about things on my own using Python and R.

I have the most coding experience in Python and R, and I have broadly explored many topics such as database management, machine learning, AI, and geocomputing. I plan to mainly branch out from my basics in these fields to solve questions I have about the world.

My favorite hobbies are surfing, hiking, swimming, weightlifting, basketball, and making music/songs.
