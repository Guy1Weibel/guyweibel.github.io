## Overview: {: .text-center}
Multilayer plastic films, common in modern packaging, pose a significant recycling challenge. Traditional mechanical recycling methods often struggle with these complex materials, contributing to the fact that less than 9% of plastic globally is actually recycled. The Solvent-Targeted Recovery and Precipitation (STRAP) process offers a promising chemical recycling route by selectively dissolving and recovering individual polymer layers. This project focused on optimizing the STRAP process, with a key emphasis on purifying and reusing solvents to enhance the method's sustainability and economic viability.

## Methods: {: .text-center}
The STRAP process involves several key steps:   
-Adding polymer films to a solvent  
-Heating the mixture to dissolve the polymer  
-Collecting and cooling the solutuion, allowing the polymer to precipitate  
-Separating the precipitated polymer from the solvent via filtration  
-The remaining solvent

## Key Achievements {: .text-center}

*   **Process Optimization & Yield Improvement:**
    *   Optimized the STRAP parameters (solvent choice, temperature, dissolution time, vessel), achieving up to **94% yield** of targeted polymers, including polyethylene (PE), ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH), and polyethylene 
terephthalate (PET).

*   **Process Scaling & Collaboration:**
    *   Collaborated with engineering staff to scale up the STRAP process.
    *   Successfully increased plastic film batch processing sizes by **500%**, transitioning from lab-scale experiments to pilot-scale 
capabilities.

*   **Material Production for Pilot Demonstration:**
    *   Produced **one kilogram of recycled polyethylene** (rPE). This material was supplied for a pilot film manufacturing demonstration, 
showcasing the viability of the recycled polymer in new product applications.

*   **Analytical Chemistry & Solvent Management:**
    *   Utilized analytical chemistry techniques (e.g., Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry - GC-MS) to quantify solvent composition during 
the recycling process.
    *   Assessed solvent reusability, a critical factor for the economic and environmental sustainability of the process.
    *   Developed and tested a method for plasticizer and contaminant removal (e.g., inks) from the process solvent using **adsorption 
techniques**, enabling effective solvent reuse and improving the quality of the recovered polymer (e.g., making it clearer instead of 
tinted).

*   **Equipment Design & Development Support:**
    *   Contributed to the design and construction of a **pressurized piston system/vessel**.
    *   This system was engineered to handle larger sample volumes and higher solvent quantities.
    *   The piston mechanism facilitated the efficient removal of residual solvent from the precipitated polymer, improving polymer purity 
and drying efficiency.

## Challenges & Learnings
One of the main challenges was effectively separating PE from other polymers in multilayer structures, particularly when dealing with printed 
films that introduced inks and adhesives as contaminants. Developing selective dissolution and precipitation steps, along with effective 
adsorbent-based purification for both polymer and solvent, were key learning experiences. This project provided deep insights into polymer 
chemistry, process engineering, and analytical method development.

While this project was heavily rooted in chemical engineering, the systematic approach to optimization, data collection from experiments, and 
analysis of results (e.g., yield, purity, solvent composition) honed analytical skills valuable in any data-driven field.
